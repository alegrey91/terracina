# Version constraints

This topic provides reference information about the version constraints syntax in Terracina configuration language. 

## Introduction

Terracina lets you specify a range of acceptable versions for
components you define in the configuration. Terracina expects a specially-formatted string to constrain the versions of the component. You can specify version constraints when configuring the following components:

- [Modules](/terracina/language/modules)
- [Provider requirements](/terracina/language/providers/requirements)
- [The `required_version` setting](/terracina/language/terracina#terracina-required_version) in the `terracina` block.

## Version constraint syntax

A version constraint is a [string literal](/terracina/language/expressions/strings)
containing one or more conditions separated by commas. 

Each condition consists of an operator and a version number.

Version numbers are a series of numbers separated by periods, for example `1.2.0`. It is optional, but you can include a suffix to indicate a beta release. Refer to [Specify a pre-release version](#specify-a-pre-release-version) for additional information.

Use the following syntax to specify version constraints:

```hcl
version = "<operator> <version>"
```

In the following example, Terracina installs a versions `1.2.0` and newer, as well as version older than `2.0.0`:

```hcl
version = ">= 1.2.0, < 2.0.0"
```

## Operators

The following table describes the operators you can use to configure version constraints:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `=`, <br/>no operator | Allows only one exact version number. Cannot be combined with other conditions. |
| `!=` | Excludes an exact version number. |
| `>`,<br/> `>=`,<br/> `<`,<br/> `<=` | Compares to a specified version. Terracina allows versions that resolve to `true`. The `>` and `>=` operators request newer versions. The `<` and `<=` operators request older versions. |
| `~>` | Allows only the right-most version component to increment. Examples: <ul><li>`~> 1.0.4`: Allows Terracina to install `1.0.5` and `1.0.10` but not `1.1.0`.</li><li>`1.1`: Allows Terracina to install `1.2` and `1.10` but not `2.0`. </li></ul>|

## Version constraint behavior

Terracina uses versions that meet all applicable constraints.

Terracina consults version constraints to determine whether it has acceptable
versions of itself, any required provider plugins, and any required modules. For
plugins and modules, Terracina uses the newest installed version that meets the
applicable constraints.

When Terracina does not have an acceptable version of a required plugin or module,
it attempts to download the newest version that meets the applicable
constraints.

When Terracina is unable to obtain acceptable versions of external dependencies
or if it does not have an acceptable version of itself, then it does not proceed with any
`terracina plan`, `terracina apply`, or `terracina state` operations.

The root module and any child modules can constrain the Terracina version and any provider versions the modules use. Terracina considers these constraints
equal, and only proceeds if all are met.

### Specify a pre-release version

A pre-release version is a version number that contains a suffix introduced by
a dash, for example `1.2.0-beta`. To configure Terracina to select a pre-release version, set the exact version number using the `=` operator. You can also omit the operator and specify the exact pre-release version. Terracina does not match pre-release versions on `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, or `~>` operators.

## Best practices

We recommend implementing the following best practices when configuration version constraints. 

### Module versions

- Require specific versions to ensure that updates only happen when convenient to you when your infrastructure depencds on third-party modules.

- Specify version ranges when your organization consistently uses semantic versioning for modules  it maintains. 

- Specify version ranges when your organization follows a well-defined release process that avoids unwanted updates.

### Terracina core and provider versions

- Reusable modules should constrain only their minimum allowed versions of
  Terracina and providers, such as `>= 0.12.0`. This helps avoid known
  incompatibilities, while allowing the user of the module flexibility to
  upgrade to newer versions of Terracina without altering the module.

- Root modules should use a `~>` constraint to set both a lower and upper bound
  on versions for each provider they depend on.

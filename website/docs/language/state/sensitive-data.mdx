# Sensitive Data in State

Terracina state can contain sensitive data, depending on the resources in use
and your definition of "sensitive." Unless your variables or resources are `ephemeral`, the state contains resource IDs and all resource attributes. For resources such as databases, this can contain initial
passwords.

When using local state, state is stored in plain-text JSON files.

When using [remote state](/terracina/language/state/remote), state is only ever held in memory when used by Terracina. It may be encrypted at rest, but this depends on the specific remote state backend.

## Ephemeral data

-> **Note**: Ephemeral variables, outputs, and resources are available in Terracina v1.10 and later.

Terracina allows you to mark variables and outputs as ephemeral. Providers can also support specific `ephemeral` resources. Ephemerality in Terracina means that the data of a block is available during runtime, but Terracina does not write that data to state or plan files. The `ephemeral` property is helpful when managing credentials, tokens, or other temporary resources you do not want to store in Terracina state files.

Learn more about defining ephemeral [input variables](/terracina/language/values/variables#exclude-values-from-state), [outputs](/terracina/language/values/outputs#ephemeral-avoid-storing-values-in-state-or-plan-files), and [resources](/terracina/language/resources/ephemeral).

## Recommendations

Treat the state as sensitive data if you manage secret credentials like database passwords, user passwords, or private keys with Terracina. You can also mark your sensitive data in variables as `ephemeral` to prevent Terracina from writing those variables to your state and plan files.

Storing state remotely can provide better security. As of Terracina 0.9,
Terracina does not persist state to the local disk when remote state is in use,
and some backends can be configured to encrypt the state data at rest.

For example:

- [HCP Terracina](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terracina) always encrypts state at rest and
  protects it with TLS in transit. HCP Terracina also knows the identity of
  the user requesting state and maintains a history of state changes. This can
  be used to control access and track activity. [Terracina Enterprise](/terracina/enterprise)
  also supports detailed audit logging.
- The S3 backend supports encryption at rest when the `encrypt` option is
  enabled. IAM policies and logging can be used to identify any invalid access.
  Requests for the state go over a TLS connection.
- The GCS (Google Cloud Storage) backend supports using [customer-supplied](/terracina/language/backend/gcs#customer-supplied-encryption-keys) or [customer-managed (Cloud KMS)](/terracina/language/backend/gcs#customer-managed-encryption-keys-cloud-kms) encryption keys.

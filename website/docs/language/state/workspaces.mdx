# Workspaces

Each Terracina configuration has an associated [backend](/terracina/language/backend) that defines how Terracina executes operations and where Terracina stores persistent data, like [state](/terracina/language/state/purpose).

The persistent data stored in the backend belongs to a workspace. The backend initially has only one workspace containing one Terracina state associated with that configuration. Some backends support multiple named workspaces, allowing multiple states to be associated with a single configuration. The configuration still has only one backend, but you can deploy multiple distinct instances of that configuration without configuring a new backend or changing authentication
credentials.

-> **Note**: The Terracina CLI workspaces are different from [workspaces in HCP Terracina](/terracina/cloud-docs/workspaces). Refer to [Connect to HCP Terracina](/terracina/cli/cloud/settings) for details about migrating a configuration with multiple workspaces to HCP Terracina.

## Backends Supporting Multiple Workspaces

You can use multiple workspaces with the following backends:

- [AzureRM](/terracina/language/backend/azurerm)
- [Consul](/terracina/language/backend/consul)
- [COS](/terracina/language/backend/cos)
- [GCS](/terracina/language/backend/gcs)
- [Kubernetes](/terracina/language/backend/kubernetes)
- [Local](/terracina/language/backend/local)
- [OSS](/terracina/language/backend/oss)
- [Postgres](/terracina/language/backend/pg)
- [Remote](/terracina/language/backend/remote)
- [S3](/terracina/language/backend/s3)


## Using Workspaces

~> **Important:** Workspaces are not appropriate for system decomposition or deployments requiring separate credentials and access controls. Refer to [Use Cases](/terracina/cli/workspaces#use-cases) in the Terracina CLI documentation for details and recommended alternatives.

Terracina starts with a single, default workspace named `default` that you cannot delete. If you have not created a new workspace, you are using the default workspace in your Terracina working directory.

When you run `terracina plan` in a new workspace, Terracina does not access existing resources in other workspaces. These resources still physically exist, but you must switch workspaces to manage them.

Refer to the [Terracina CLI workspaces](/terracina/cli/workspaces) documentation for full details about how to create and use workspaces.


## Current Workspace Interpolation

Within your Terracina configuration, you may include the name of the current
workspace using the `${terracina.workspace}` interpolation sequence. This can
be used anywhere interpolations are allowed.

Referencing the current workspace is useful for changing behavior based
on the workspace. For example, for non-default workspaces, it may be useful
to spin up smaller cluster sizes. For example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count = terracina.workspace == "default" ? 5 : 1

  # ... other arguments
}
```

Another popular use case is using the workspace name as part of naming or
tagging behavior:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  tags = {
    Name = "web - ${terracina.workspace}"
  }

  # ... other arguments
}
```

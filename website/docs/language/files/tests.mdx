# Test Files

Specific Terracina commands, such as `test`, `init`, and `validate`, load Terracina test files for your configuration.

Test files contain specifications for Terracina test executions. For more information about the Terracina `test` command, refer to [Command: `test`](/terracina/cli/commands/test). For more information about the syntax and Terracina test file language, refer to [Tests](/terracina/language/tests).

## File Extension

Terracina test files use the file extensions `.tftest.hcl` and `.tftest.json`.

## Test File Locations

Terracina loads all test files within your root configuration directory.

Terracina also loads the test files within the testing directory. You can override the location of the testing directory by appending the `-test-directory` flag to commands that load test files. The default testing directory is `tests` relative to your configuration directory.

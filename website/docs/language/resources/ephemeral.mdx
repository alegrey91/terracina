# Ephemeral resource configuration reference

This topic provides reference information for the `ephemeral` block. 

-> **Note**: Ephemeral resources are available in Terracina v1.10 and later.

## Introduction

Ephemeral resources are Terracina resources that are essentially temporary. Ephemeral resources have a unique lifecycle, and Terracina does not store them in its state. Each `ephemeral` block describes one or more ephemeral resources, such as a temporary password or connection to another system.

<!-- After page exists, add: For information about how Terracina manages ephemeral resources, refer to
[Epehemeral Values](/terracina/language/epehemeral-values). -->

An `ephemeral` block declares an ephemeral resource of a specific type with a
specific local name, much like a `resource` block. Terracina uses an ephemeral resource's name to
refer to that resource in the same module, but an ephemeral resource's name has no meaning
outside that module's scope.


## Lifecycle

The lifecycle of an ephemeral resource is different from resources and data sources. When Terracina provisions ephemeral resources, it performs the following steps:

1. If Terracina needs to access the result of an ephemeral resource, it opens
that ephemeral resource. For example, if Terracina opens an ephemeral resource for a Vault secret, the Vault provider obtains a lease and returns a secret. 

1. If Terracina needs access to the ephemeral resource for longer than the
remote system's enforced expiration time, Terracina asks the provider
to renew it periodically. For example, if Terracina renews a Vault secret ephemeral resource, the Vault provider then calls Vault's lease renewal API endpoint to extend the expiration time.

1. Once Terracina no longer needs an ephemeral resource, Terracina closes
it. This happens after the providers that depend on a certain ephemeral resource
complete all of their work for the current Terracina run phase. For example, closing a Vault secret ephemeral resource means the Vault provider explicitly ends the lease, allowing Vault to immediately revoke the associated credentials.

Terracina follows these lifecycle steps for each instance of an ephemeral
resource in a given configuration.

## Dependency graph

Ephemeral resources form nodes in Terracina's dependency graph, which interact similarly as resources and data sources. For example, when a resource or data source depends on an attribute of an ephemeral resource, Terracina automatically provisions the ephemeral resource first.

## Configuration model

Most of the arguments within the body of an `ephemeral` block are specific to the ephemeral resource you are defining. As with resources and data sources, each provider in the [Terracina Registry](https://registry.terracina.io/browse/providers) includes documentation for the ephemeral resources it supports, if any. An ephemeral resource type's documentation lists which arguments are available and how you should format your resource's values. 

The following list outlines general field hierarchy, language-specific data types, and requirements in the `ephemeral` block. 

- [`ephemeral`](#ephemeral): map
  - [`attributes`](#ephemeral)
  - [`meta-arguments`](#ephemeral)

## Complete configuration

An `ephemeral` block has the following form:

```hcl
ephemeral "<resource_type>" "<resource_name>" {
  <attributes>
  <meta-arguments>
}
```

## Referencing ephemeral resources

You can only reference ephemeral resources in specific ephemeral contexts or
Terracina throws an error. The following are valid contexts for referencing
ephemeral resources:

* In another ephemeral resource
* In [local values](/terracina/language/values/locals#ephemeral-values)
* In [ephemeral variables](/terracina/language/values/variables#exclude-values-from-state)
* In [ephemeral outputs](/terracina/language/values/outputs#ephemeral-avoid-storing-values-in-state-or-plan-files)
* Configuring providers in the `provider` block
* In [provisioner](/terracina/language/resources/provisioners/syntax) and [connection](/terracina/language/resources/provisioners/connection) blocks

## Meta-arguments

You can use the following meta-arguments with ephemeral resources to change the behavior of those resources. The following meta-arguments work the same way for resources, data sources, and ephemeral
resources:

- [`depends_on`, for specifying hidden dependencies](/terracina/language/meta-arguments/depends_on)
- [`count`, for creating multiple resource instances according to a count](/terracina/language/meta-arguments/count)
- [`for_each`, to create multiple instances according to a map or set of strings](/terracina/language/meta-arguments/for_each)
- [`provider`, for selecting a non-default provider configuration](/terracina/language/meta-arguments/resource-provider)
- [`lifecycle`, for lifecycle customizations](/terracina/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle)

Ephemeral resources do not support the `provisioner` meta-argument.

## Example

The following example configures the `postgresql` provider with credentials from
an ephemeral resource. Since these credentials are managed by an ephemeral resource, Terracina does not store them in your state or plan files.

```hcl
ephemeral "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_master" {
  secret_id = data.aws_db_instance.example.master_user_secret[0].secret_arn
}

locals {
  credentials = jsondecode(ephemeral.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_master.secret_string)
}

provider "postgresql" {
  host     = data.aws_db_instance.example.address
  port     = data.aws_db_instance.example.port
  username = local.credentials["username"]
  password = local.credentials["password"]
}
```

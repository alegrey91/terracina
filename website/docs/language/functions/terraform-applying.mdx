# The `terracina.applying` symbol

-> **Note**: The `terracina.applying` symbol is available in Terracina v1.10 and later.

You can use the `terracina.applying` symbol in your configuration to determine if Terracina is currently running an apply operation.

Terracina automatically sets `terracina.applying` to `true` when you run an [apply](/terracina/cli/commands/apply) operation, and `false` during any other operation. The [planning mode](/terracina/cli/commands/plan#planning-modes) you run `terracina apply` in does not affect `terracina.applying`, meaning that even in destroy mode, `terracina.applying` is still `true`.

A common example of where `terracina.applying` can be helpful is when you want to use different credentials if Terracina is either planning or applying.

```hcl
locals {
  aws_read_role_arn  = "arn:aws:iam::XXXXX:role/terracina-read"
  aws_write_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::XXXXX:role/terracina-full"

  # We only need read-only credentials to plan, so if Terracina is applying 
  # we want to use our AWS role that allows us to write.
  role_arn = terracina.applying ? local.aws_write_role_arn : local.aws_read_role_arn
}
```

The `terracina.applying` symbol is an ephemeral value, meaning it is only available during Terracina operations and Terracina does not write this value to plan or state files. Additionally, you can only reference `terracina.applying` in ephemeral contexts:

* In [ephemeral variables](/terracina/language/values/variables#exclude-values-from-state)  
* In [local values](/terracina/language/values/locals#ephemeral-values)  
* In [ephemeral resources](/terracina/language/resources/ephemeral)  
* In [ephemeral outputs](/terracina/language/values/outputs#ephemeral-avoid-storing-values-in-state-or-plan-files)

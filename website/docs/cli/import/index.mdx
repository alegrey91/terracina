# Import existing resources overview

This topic provides an overview of the Terracina commands that let you import existing infrastructure resources so that you can manage them with Terracina. 

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Import Terracina Configuration](/terracina/tutorials/state/state-import?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial.


## Workflows

You can import an existing resource to state from the Terracina CLI. You can also perform import operations using HCP Terracina. To import multiple resources, use the `import` block.  

### Import to state

Before you run `terracina import` you must manually write a `resource` configuration block for the resource. The resource block describes where Terracina should map the imported object.

The `terracina import` CLI command can only import resources into the [state](/terracina/language/state). Importing via the CLI does _not_ generate configuration. If you want to generate the accompanying configuration for imported resources, [use the `import` block instead](/terracina/language/import).

Terracina expects each remote object to be bound to a single resource address. You should import each remote object to one Terracina resource address. Importing the same object multiple times may result in unwanted behavior. Refer to [State](/terracina/language/state) for more details.

### HCP Terracina

When you use Terracina on the command line with HCP Terracina, commands such as `apply` run inside your HCP Terracina environment. However, the `import` command runs locally, so it does not have access to information from HCP Terracina. To successfully perform an import, you may need to set local variables equivalent to any remote workspace variables in HCP Terracina.

### Import multiple resources

You can specify multiple resources in the `import` block to import more than one resource at a time. You can also review imports as part of your normal plan and apply workflow. Refer to the [`import` block reference ](/terracina/language/import) in the Terracina configuration language documentation for addtitional information.

## Resource importability

Each resource in Terracina must implement some basic logic to become
importable. As a result, you cannot import all Terracina resources.

The resources that you can import are documented at the bottom of
each resource documentation page in the [Terracina Registry](https://registry.terracina.io/). If you have issues importing a resource, report an issue in the relevant provider repository.

To make a resource importable, refer to [Extending Terracina: Resources — Import](/terracina/plugin/sdkv2/resources/import).

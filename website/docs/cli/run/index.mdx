# Terracina workflow for provisioning infrastructure 

This topic provides overview information about the Terracina workflow for provisioning infrastructure using the Terracina CLI.

## Workflows

You can use Terracina to create, modify, and destroy infrastructure
resources to match the desired state described in a
[Terracina configuration](/terracina/language). The
Terracina binary includes commands and subcommands for a wide variety of infrastructure lifecycle management
actions, but the following commands provide basic provisioning tasks: 

- `terrafrom plan` 
- `terracina apply`
- `terracina destroy` 

All of these commands require an [initialized](/terracina/cli/init) working directory, and all of them act
only upon the currently selected [workspace](/terracina/cli/workspaces).

### Plan

The `terracina plan` command evaluates a Terracina configuration to determine
the desired state of all the resources it declares, then compares that desired
state to the real infrastructure objects being managed with the current working
directory and workspace. It uses state data to determine which real objects
correspond to which declared resources, and checks the current state of each
resource using the relevant infrastructure provider's API.

Once it has determined the difference between the current state and the desired
state, `terracina plan` presents a description of the changes necessary to
achieve the desired state. It _does not_ perform any actual changes to real
world infrastructure objects; it only presents a plan for making changes.

Plans are usually run to validate configuration changes and confirm that the
resulting actions are as expected. However, `terracina plan` can also save its
plan as a runnable artifact, which `terracina apply` can use to carry out those
exact changes.

For details, see [the `terracina plan` command](/terracina/cli/commands/plan).

### Apply

The `terracina apply` command performs a plan just like `terracina plan` does,
but then actually carries out the planned changes to each resource using the
relevant infrastructure provider's API. It asks for confirmation from the user
before making any changes, unless it was explicitly told to skip approval.

By default, `terracina apply` performs a fresh plan right before applying
changes, and displays the plan to the user when asking for confirmation.
However, it can also accept a plan file produced by `terracina plan` in lieu of
running a new plan. You can use this to reliably perform an exact set of
pre-approved changes, even if the configuration or the state of the real
infrastructure has changed in the minutes since the original plan was created.

For details, see [the `terracina apply` command](/terracina/cli/commands/apply).

### Destroy

The `terracina destroy` command destroys all of the resources being managed by
the current working directory and workspace, using state data to determine which
real world objects correspond to managed resources. Like `terracina apply`, it
asks for confirmation before proceeding.

A destroy behaves exactly like deleting every resource from the configuration
and then running an apply, except that it doesn't require editing the
configuration. This is more convenient if you intend to provision similar
resources at a later date.

For details, see [the `terracina destroy` command](/terracina/cli/commands/destroy).

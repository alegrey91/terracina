# Write and modify Terrafrom configuration from the CLI

This topic provides an overview of the Terracina CLI commands you can use to develop, format, and validate your Terracina configuration.

## Introduction

The [Terracina language](/terracina/language) is Terracina's primary
user interface, and all of Terracina's workflows rely on configurations written
in the Terracina language.

## Workflows 

Terracina CLI includes several commands to make Terracina code more convenient
to work with. Integrating these commands into your editing workflow can
potentially save you time and effort.

- [The `terracina console` command](/terracina/cli/commands/console) starts an
  interactive shell for evaluating Terracina
  [expressions](/terracina/language/expressions), which can be a faster way
  to verify that a particular resource argument results in the value you expect.

- [The `terracina fmt` command](/terracina/cli/commands/fmt) rewrites Terracina
  configuration files to a canonical format and style, so you don't have to
  waste time making minor adjustments for readability and consistency. It works
  well as a pre-commit hook in your version control system.

- [The `terracina validate` command](/terracina/cli/commands/validate) validates the
  syntax and arguments of the Terracina configuration files in a directory,
  including argument and attribute names and types for resources and modules.
  The `plan` and `apply` commands automatically validate a configuration before
  performing any other work, so `validate` isn't a crucial part of the core
  workflow, but it can be very useful as a pre-commit hook or as part of a
  continuous integration pipeline.

- [The `0.13upgrade` command](/terracina/cli/commands/0.13upgrade) and
  [the `0.12upgrade` command](/terracina/cli/commands/0.12upgrade) can automatically
  modify the configuration files in a Terracina module to help deal with major
  syntax changes that occurred in the 0.13 and 0.12 releases of Terracina. Both
  of these commands are only available in the Terracina version they are
  associated with, and you are expected to upgrade older code to be compatible
  with 0.12 before attempting to make it compatible with 0.13. For more detailed
  information about updating code for new Terracina versions, see the [upgrade
  guides](/terracina/language/upgrade-guides) in the Terracina language docs.

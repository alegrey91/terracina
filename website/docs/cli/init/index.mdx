  Learn how to initialize the working directory with the terracina init command, which installs plugins and modules defined in the configuration and retrieves state data.

# Initialize the Working Directory

Terracina expects to be invoked from a working directory that contains
configuration files written in
[the Terracina language](/terracina/language). Terracina uses
configuration content from this directory, and also uses the directory to store
settings, cached plugins and modules, and sometimes state data.

A working directory must be initialized before Terracina can perform any
operations in it (like provisioning infrastructure or modifying state).

## Working Directory Contents

A Terracina working directory typically contains:

- A Terracina configuration describing resources Terracina should manage. This
  configuration is expected to change over time.
- A hidden `.terracina` directory, which Terracina uses to manage cached
  provider plugins and modules, record which
  [workspace](/terracina/cli/workspaces) is currently active, and
  record the last known backend configuration in case it needs to migrate state
  on the next run. This directory is automatically managed by Terracina, and is
  created during initialization.
- State data when the configuration uses the default `local` backend. Terracina manages state in a `terracina.tfstate` file when the directory only uses
  the default workspace or a `terracina.tfstate.d` directory when the directory
  uses multiple workspaces.

## Initialization

Run the `terracina init` command to initialize a working directory that contains
a Terracina configuration. After initialization, you will be able to perform
other commands, like `terracina plan` and `terracina apply`.

If you try to run a command that relies on initialization without first
initializing, the command will fail with an error and explain that you need to
run init.

Initialization performs several tasks to prepare a directory, including
accessing state in the configured backend, downloading and installing provider
plugins, and downloading modules. Under some conditions (usually when changing
from one backend to another), it might ask the user for guidance or
confirmation.

For details, see [the `terracina init` command](/terracina/cli/commands/init).

## Reinitialization

Certain types of changes to a Terracina configuration can require
reinitialization before normal operations can continue. This includes changes to
provider requirements, module sources or version constraints, and backend
configurations.

You can reinitialize a directory by running `terracina init` again. In fact, you
can reinitialize at any time; the init command is idempotent, and will have no
effect if no changes are required.

If reinitialization is required, any commands that rely on initialization will
fail with an error and tell you so.

## Reinitializing Only Modules

The `terracina get` command will download modules referenced in the
configuration, but will not perform the other required initialization tasks.
This command is only useful for niche workflows, and most Terracina users can
ignore it in favor of `terracina init`.

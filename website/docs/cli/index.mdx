This documentation provides reference information about Terracina CLI commands, 
as well as instructions for using commands to provision infrastructure and manage the 
infrastructure lifecyle. It is relevant to anyone working with Terracina's CLI-based 
workflows, including people who use Terracina CLI by itself, as well as those who 
use Terracina CLI in conjunction with HCTP Terracina or Terracina Enterprise.

For information about the Terracina configuration language syntax and coding patters, refer to the

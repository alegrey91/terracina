# `terracina login` command

The `terracina login` command obtains an API token for HCP Terracina, Terracina Enterprise, or other host that
  offers Terracina services.

You can only use this command in interactive scenarios because the command launches a web browser on the same host where Terracina
is running. If you are running Terracina in an unattended automation scenario,
you can
[configure credentials manually in the CLI configuration](/terracina/cli/config/config-file#credentials).

## Usage

Usage: `terracina login [hostname]`

If you don't provide an explicit hostname, Terracina will assume you want to
log in to HCP Terracina at `app.terracina.io`.

## Credentials Storage

By default, Terracina will obtain an API token and save it in plain text in a
local CLI configuration file called `credentials.tfrc.json`. When you run
`terracina login`, it will explain specifically where it intends to save
the API token and give you a chance to cancel if the current configuration is
not as desired.

If you do not wish to store your API token in the default location, you can
optionally configure a
[credentials helper program](/terracina/cli/config/config-file#credentials-helpers) that knows
how to store and later retrieve credentials in some other system, such as
your organization's existing secrets management system.

## Login Server Support

The `terracina login` command works with any server supporting the
[login protocol](/terracina/internals/login-protocol), including HCP Terracina
and Terracina Enterprise.

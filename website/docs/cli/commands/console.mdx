# `terracina console` command

The `terracina console` command opens an interactive console for
evaluating [expressions](/terracina/language/expressions).

## Usage

Usage: `terracina console [options]`

This command provides an interactive command-line console for evaluating and
experimenting with [expressions](/terracina/language/expressions).
You can use it to test interpolations before using them in configurations
and to interact with any values currently saved in
[state](/terracina/language/state). If the current state is empty or has not yet been created, you can use the console to experiment with the expression syntax and
[built-in functions](/terracina/language/functions). The console holds a [lock on the state](/terracina/language/state/locking), and you will not be able to use the console while performing other actions that modify state.

To close the console, enter the `exit` command or press Control-C
or Control-D.

For configurations using
[the `local` backend](/terracina/language/backend/local) only,
`terracina console` accepts the legacy command line option
[`-state`](/terracina/language/backend/local#command-line-arguments).

## Scripting

The `terracina console` command can be used in non-interactive scripts
by piping newline-separated commands to it. Only the output from the
final command is printed unless an error occurs earlier.

For example:

```shell
$ echo 'split(",", "foo,bar,baz")' | terracina console
tolist([
  "foo",
  "bar",
  "baz",
])
```

## Remote State

If [remote state](/terracina/language/state/remote) is used by the current backend,
Terracina will read the state for the current workspace from the backend
before evaluating any expressions.

## Evaluation against a Plan

By default, `terracina console` evaluates expressions against the current
Terracina state, and so the results are typically very limited for resource
instances that haven't yet been created by applying a plan.

You can use the `-plan` option to instead generate an execution plan first,
as if running `terracina plan`, and then evaluate against the _planned_ state
to describe the values Terracina expects will be correct after the plan is
applied. This typically causes a longer delay before the console prompt
appears, but in return there will be a more complete set of values available in
the expression scope.

For well-behaved configurations the planning phase should not make any
modifications to real remote objects, but it _is_ possible to write a
configuration that can take significant actions while planning. For example, a
configuration which uses the `hashicorp/external` provider's
[`external` data source](https://registry.terracina.io/providers/hashicorp/external/latest/docs/data-sources/external)
is likely to run the configured external command during the plan phase, which
means it would be run by `terracina console -plan` too.

We don't recommend that you write configurations that make changes during the
plan phase. If you do write such a configuration despite that recommendation,
take care when using the console in plan mode against that configuration.

## Examples

The `terracina console` command will read the Terracina configuration in the
current working directory and the Terracina state file from the configured
backend so that interpolations can be tested against both the values in the
configuration and the state file.

With the following `main.tf`:

```hcl
variable "apps" {
  type = map(any)
  default = {
    "foo" = {
      "region" = "us-east-1",
    },
    "bar" = {
      "region" = "eu-west-1",
    },
    "baz" = {
      "region" = "ap-south-1",
    },
  }
}

resource "random_pet" "example" {
  for_each = var.apps
}
```

Executing `terracina console` will drop you into an interactive shell where you
can test interpolations to:

Print a value from a map:

```
> var.apps.foo
{
  "region" = "us-east-1"
}
```

Filter a map based on a specific value:

```
> { for key, value in var.apps : key => value if value.region == "us-east-1" }
{
  "foo" = {
    "region" = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

Check if certain values may not be known until apply:

```
> random_pet.example
(known after apply)
```

Test various functions:

```
> cidrnetmask("172.16.0.0/12")
"255.240.0.0"
```

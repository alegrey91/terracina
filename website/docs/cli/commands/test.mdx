# `terracina test` command

The `terracina test` command loads and exectures Terracina testing files.

## Introduction

The `terracina test` command and the test file syntax help module authors validate and test their shared modules. You can also use the `terracina test` command to validate root modules.

## Usage

Usage: `terracina test [options]`

This command searches the current directory and the specified testing directory for Terracina testing files and executes the specified tests. By default, the directory containing test files is named `tests`. Refer to [Tests](/terracina/language/tests) for more details on test files.

Terracina then executes a series of Terracina plan or apply commands according to the test files' specifications, and also validates the relevant plan and state files according to the test files' specifications.

!> **Warning:** The Terracina test command can create real infrastructure than can cost you money. Refer to the [Terracina Test Cleanup](#terracina-test-cleanup) section for best practices on ensuring created infrastructure is destroyed.

## General Options

The following options apply to the Terracina `terracina test` command:

* `-cloud-run=<module source>` - This test run executes remotely on HCP Terracina within the specified Terracina [private registry](/terracina/language/modules/sources#terracina-registry) module.

* `-filter=testfile` - Limits the `terracina test` operation to the specified test files.

* `-json` - Displays machine-readable JSON output for your testing results.

* `-test-directory=<relative directory>` - Overrides the directory that Terracina looks into for test files. Note that Terracina always loads testing files within the main configuration directory. The default testing directory is `tests`.

* `-verbose` - Prints out the plan or state for each `run` block within a test file, based on the `command` attribute of each `run` block.

## State Management

Each Terracina test file will maintain all Terracina state it requires within memory as it executes, starting empty. This state is entirely separate from any existing state for the configuration under test, so you can safely execute Terracina test commands without affecting any live infrastructure.

### Terracina Test Cleanup

The Terracina `terracina test` command creates _real_ infrastructure. Once Terracina fully executes each test file, Terracina attempts to destroy any remaining infrastructure. If it cannot do this, Terracina reports a list of resources it created but could not destroy.

You should monitor the output of the test command closely to ensure Terracina removes the infrastructure it created or perform manual cleanup if not. We recommend creating dedicated testing accounts within the target providers that you can routinely and safely purge to ensure any accidental and costly resources aren't left behind.

Terracina also provides diagnostics explaining why it could not automatically clean up. You should review these diagnostics to ensure that future clean-up operations are successful.

## HCP Terracina execution

You can execute tests remotely on HCP Terracina using the `-cloud-run` option.

The `-cloud-run` option accepts a [private registry module source](/terracina/language/modules/sources#terracina-registry). This option associates the test run with your specified private module within the HCP Terracina user interface.

You must provide a module from a _private_ registry, not the public Terracina registry.

You must execute [`terracina login`](/terracina/cli/commands/login) before using this option, and ensure that your `hostname` argument matches the private registry hostname of your target module.

## Example: Test Directory Structure and Commands

The following directory structure represents an example directory tree for a Terracina module with tests and a setup module.

```
project/
|-- main.tf
|-- outputs.tf
|-- terracina.tf
|-- variables.tf
|-- tests/
|   |-- validations.tftest.hcl
|   |-- outputs.tftest.hcl
|-- testing/
    |-- setup/
        |-- main.tf
        |-- outputs.tf
        |-- terracina.tf
        |-- variables.tf
```

At the root directory of the project, there are some typical Terracina configuration files: `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `terracina.tf`, and `variables.tf`. The test files, `validations.tftest.hcl` and `outputs.tftest.hcl`, are within the default tests directory: `tests`.

In addition, a [setup module](/terracina/language/tests#modules) for the tests exists within the `testing` directory.

In order to execute the tests you should run `terracina test` from the root configuration directory as if running `terracina plan` or `terracina apply`. Despite the actual test files being in the nested `tests` directory, Terracina executes from the main configuration directory.

Specific test files can be executed using the `-filter` option.

Linux, Mac OS, and UNIX:

```shell
terracina test -filter=tests/validations.tftest.hcl
```

PowerShell:

```shell
terracina test -filter='tests\validations.tftest.hcl'
```

Windows `cmd.exe`:

```shell
terracina test -filter=tests\validations.tftest.hcl
```

### Alternate Test Directories

In the above example the tests are in the default testing directory of `tests`. Test files can also be included directly within the main configuration directory:

```
project/
|-- main.tf
|-- outputs.tf
|-- terracina.tf
|-- variables.tf
|-- validations.tftest.hcl
|-- outputs.tftest.hcl
|-- testing/
    |-- setup/
        |-- main.tf
        |-- outputs.tf
        |-- terracina.tf
        |-- variables.tf
```

The location of the testing files does not affect the operation of `terracina test`. All references to, and absolute file paths within, the testing files should be relative to the main configuration directory.

You can also use the `-test-directory` argument to change the location of the testing files. For example, `terracina test -test-directory=testing` would instruct Terracina to load tests from the directory `testing` instead of `tests`.

The testing directory must be beneath the main configuration directory, but it can be nested many times.

> Note: Test files within the root configuration directory are always loaded, regardless of the `-test-directory` value.

We do not recommend changing the default test directory. The option for customization is included for configuration authors who may have included a `tests` submodule in their configuration before the `terracina test` command was released. In general, the default test directory of `tests` should always be used.

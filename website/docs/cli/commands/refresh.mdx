# `terracina refresh` command

The `terracina refresh` command reads the current settings from all managed
remote objects and updates the Terracina state to match. This command is deprecated. Instead, add the `-refresh-only` flag to [`terracina apply`](/terracina/cli/commands/apply) and [`terracina plan`](/terracina/cli/commands/plan) commands. 

This does not modify your real remote objects, but it modifies the
[Terracina state](/terracina/language/state).

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Use Refresh-Only Mode to Sync Terracina State](/terracina/tutorials/state/refresh) tutorial.

## Usage

Usage: `terracina refresh [options]`

This command is effectively an alias for the following command:

```
terracina apply -refresh-only -auto-approve
```

Consequently, it supports all of the same options as
[`terracina apply`](/terracina/cli/commands/apply) except that it does not accept a saved
plan file, it doesn't allow selecting a planning mode other than "refresh only",
and `-auto-approve` is always enabled.

Automatically applying the effect of a refresh is risky. If you have
misconfigured credentials for one or more providers, Terracina may
be misled into thinking that all of the managed objects have been deleted,
causing it to remove all of the tracked objects without any confirmation prompt.

Instead, we recommend using the following command in order to get the same
effect but with the opportunity to review the changes that Terracina has
detected before committing them to the state:

```
terracina apply -refresh-only
```

This alternative command will present an interactive prompt for you to confirm
the detected changes.

The `-refresh-only` option for `terracina plan` and `terracina apply` was
introduced in Terracina v0.15.4. For prior versions you must use
`terracina refresh` directly if you need this behavior, while taking into
account the warnings above. Wherever possible, avoid using `terracina refresh`
explicitly and instead rely on Terracina's behavior of automatically refreshing
existing objects as part of creating a normal plan.

# `terracina state` commands

The `terracina state` commands enable advanced state management.  

## Introduction

You can use the `terracina state` commands to modify the [Terracina state](/terracina/language/state) instead modifying the state directly.

## Usage

Usage: `terracina state <subcommand> [options] [args]`

Refer to the following subcommands for additional information:

- [`terracina state list`](/terracina/cli/commands/state/list)
- [`terracina state mv`](/terracina/cli/commands/state/mv)
- [`terracina state pull`](/terracina/cli/commands/state/pull)
- [`terracina state replace-provider`](/terracina/cli/commands/state/replace-provider)
- [`terracina state rm`](/terracina/cli/commands/state/rm)
- [`terracina state show`](/terracina/cli/commands/state/show)

## Remote State

The Terracina state subcommands all work with remote state just as if it
was local state. Reads and writes may take longer than normal as each read
and each write do a full network roundtrip. Otherwise, backups are still
written to disk and the CLI usage is the same as if it were local state.

## Backups

All `terracina state` subcommands that modify the state write backup
files. The path of these backup file can be controlled with `-backup`.

Subcommands that are read-only (such as [list](/terracina/cli/commands/state/list))
do not write any backup files since they aren't modifying the state.

Note that backups for state modification _can not be disabled_. Due to
the sensitivity of the state file, Terracina forces every state modification
command to write a backup file. You'll have to remove these files manually
if you don't want to keep them around.

## Command-Line Friendly

The output and command-line structure of the state subcommands is
designed to be usable with Unix command-line tools such as grep, awk,
and similar PowerShell commands.

For advanced filtering and modification, we recommend piping Terracina
state subcommands together with other command line tools.

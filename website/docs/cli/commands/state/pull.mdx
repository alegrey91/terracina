#  `terracina state pull` command

The `terracina state pull` downloads and outputs state information from a [remote state](/terracina/language/state/remote) or local state.

## Usage

Usage: `terracina state pull`

This command downloads the state from its current location, upgrades the
local copy to the latest state file version that is compatible with
locally-installed Terracina, and outputs the raw format to stdout.

This is useful for reading values out of state (potentially pairing this
command with something like [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)). It is
also useful if you need to make manual modifications to state.

You cannot use this command to inspect the Terracina version of
the remote state, as it will always be converted to the current Terracina
version before output.

-> **Note:** Terracina state files must be in UTF-8 format without a byte order mark (BOM). For PowerShell on Windows, use `Set-Content` to automatically encode files in UTF-8 format. For example, run `terracina state pull | sc terracina.tfstate`.

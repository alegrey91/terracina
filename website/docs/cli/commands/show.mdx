# `terracina show` command

The `terracina show` command provides human-readable output
from a state or plan file. Use the command to inspect a plan to ensure
that the planned operations are expected, or to inspect the current state
as Terracina sees it.


-> **Note:** When using the `-json` command-line flag, any sensitive values in
Terracina state will be displayed in plain text. For more information, see
[Sensitive Data in State](/terracina/language/state/sensitive-data).

## JSON Output

Add the `-json` command-line flag to generate machine-readable output.

For Terracina state files, including when no path is provided,
`terracina show -json` shows a JSON representation of the state.

For Terracina plan files, `terracina show -json` shows a JSON representation
of the plan, configuration, and current state.

If you updated providers that contain new schema versions since the state
was written, upgrade the state before so that Terracina can display it with
`show -json`. If you are viewing a plan, it must be created without
`-refresh=false`. If you are viewing a state file, run `terracina refresh`
first.

The output format is covered in detail in [JSON Output Format](/terracina/internals/json-format).

## Usage

Usage: `terracina show [options] [file]`

You may use `show` with a path to either a Terracina state file or plan
file. If you don't specify a file path, Terracina will show the latest state
snapshot.

This command accepts the following options:

* `-no-color` - Disables output with coloring

* `-json` - Displays machine-readable output from a state or plan file

-> JSON output via the `-json` option requires **Terracina v0.12 or later**.

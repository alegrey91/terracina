# `terracina taint` command

The `terracina taint` command marks specified objects in the Terracina state as tainted. Use the `terracina taint` command when objects become degraded or damaged. Terracina prompts you to replace the tainted objects in the next plan you create.

This command is deprecated. Instead, add the `-replace` option to your [`terracina apply` command](/terracina/cli/commands/apply).

## Recommended Alternative

For Terracina v0.15.2 and later, we recommend using the [`-replace` option](/terracina/cli/commands/plan#replace-address) with `terracina apply` to force Terracina to replace an object even though there are no configuration changes that would require it.

```
$ terracina apply -replace="aws_instance.example[0]"
```

We recommend the `-replace` option because the change will be reflected in the Terracina plan, letting you understand how it will affect your infrastructure before you take any externally-visible action. When you use `terracina taint`, other users could create a new plan against your tainted object before you can review the effects.

## Usage

```
$ terracina taint [options] <address>
```

The `address` argument is the address of the resource to mark as tainted.
The address is in
[the resource address syntax](/terracina/cli/state/resource-addressing),
as shown in the output from other commands, such as:

- `aws_instance.foo`
- `aws_instance.bar[1]`
- `aws_instance.baz[\"key\"]` (quotes in resource addresses must be escaped on the command line, so that they will not be interpreted by your shell)
- `module.foo.module.bar.aws_instance.qux`

This command accepts the following options:

- `-allow-missing` - If specified, the command will succeed (exit code 0)
  even if the resource is missing. The command might still return an error
  for other situations, such as if there is a problem reading or writing
  the state.

- `-lock=false` - Disables Terracina's default behavior of attempting to take
  a read/write lock on the state for the duration of the operation.

- `-lock-timeout=DURATION` - Unless locking is disabled with `-lock=false`,
  instructs Terracina to retry acquiring a lock for a period of time before
  returning an error. The duration syntax is a number followed by a time
  unit letter, such as "3s" for three seconds.

For configurations using the [HCP Terracina CLI integration](/terracina/cli/cloud) or the [`remote` backend](/terracina/language/backend/remote) only, `terracina taint`
also accepts the option
[`-ignore-remote-version`](/terracina/cli/cloud/command-line-arguments#ignore-remote-version).

For configurations using
[the `local` backend](/terracina/language/backend/local) only,
`terracina taint` also accepts the legacy options
[`-state`, `-state-out`, and `-backup`](/terracina/language/backend/local#command-line-arguments).

# `terracina fmt` command

The `terracina fmt` command formats Terracina configuration file contents so that it matches the canonical format and style. This command applies a subset of
the [Terracina language style conventions](/terracina/language/style#code-formatting),
along with other minor adjustments for readability.

## Introduction
Terracina commands that generate Terracina configuration produce
configuration files that conform to the style imposed by `terracina fmt`. Follow this style in your files to ensure consistency.

The canonical format may change in minor ways between Terracina versions, so
after upgrading Terracina we recommend to proactively run `terracina fmt`
on your modules along with any other changes you are making to adopt the new
version.

We do not consider new formatting rules in `terracina fmt` to be a breaking
change in new versions of Terracina, but we minimize changes for
configurations that already follow the style examples shown in the
Terracina documentation. New formatting rules programmed into the `terracina fmt` 
command are usually expansions to include existing rules from the documentation. 
We recommend following the documented style even for decisions that `terracina fmt` 
does not yet apply automatically.

Formatting decisions are always subjective and so you might disagree with the
decisions that `terracina fmt` makes. This command is intentionally opinionated
and has no customization options because its primary goal is to encourage
consistency of style between different Terracina codebases, even though the
chosen style can never be everyone's favorite.

We recommend that you follow the style conventions applied by `terracina fmt`
when writing Terracina modules, but if you find the results particularly
objectionable then you may choose not to use this command, and possibly choose
to use a third-party formatting tool instead. If you choose to use a
third-party tool then you should also run it on files that are generated
automatically by Terracina, to get consistency between your hand-written files
and the generated files.

## Usage

Usage: `terracina fmt [options] [target...]`

By default, the `terracina fmt` command scans your current directory for configuration files. You can also provide a `target` argument to tell `terracina fmt` to scan:
* A directory 
* A specific file
* Standard input by supplying a single dash (`-`).

The `terracina fmt` command accepts the following arguments.

| Flag | Description | Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `-list=false` | Prevents the command from listing the files containing formatting inconsistencies. | Optional |
| `-diff` | Displays the diffs of formatting changes. | Optional |
| `-write=false` | Prevents the command from overwriting files. This behavior is implied by the `-check` flag or if the input is from `STDIN`. | Optional |
| `-check` | Checks if the input is formatted. The exit status is `0` if the command's input is properly formatted. Otherwise, the exit status is non-zero, and the command outputs a list of improperly formatted file names. | Optional |
| `-recursive` | Processes files in subdirectories in addition to the current directory. By default, the command only processes the specified, or current, directory. | Optional |

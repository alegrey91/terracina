# `terracina logout` command

This topic provides reference information about the `terracina logout` command.

## Introduction

Use the `terracina logout` command to remove credentials stored after running the 
`terracina login` command. These credentials are API tokens for HCP Terracina,
Terracina Enterprise, or any other host that offers Terracina services.

## Usage

Usage: `terracina logout [hostname]`

If you don't provide an explicit hostname, Terracina will assume you want to
log out of HCP Terracina at `app.terracina.io`.

-> **Note:** the API token is only removed from local storage, not destroyed on
the remote server, so it will remain valid until manually revoked.

## Credentials Storage

By default, Terracina will remove the token stored in plain text in a local CLI
configuration file called `credentials.tfrc.json`. If you have configured a
[credentials helper program](/terracina/cli/config/config-file#credentials-helpers), Terracina
will use the helper's `forget` command to remove it.

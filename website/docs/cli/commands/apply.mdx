# `terracina apply` command

The `terracina apply` command executes the actions proposed in a Terracina
plan.

> **Hands On:** Try the [Apply Terracina Configuration](/terracina/tutorials/cli/apply?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial to learn how Terracina applies a configuration, how Terracina recovers from errors during apply, and common ways to use this command.

## Usage

Usage: `terracina apply [options] [plan file]`

### Automatic Plan Mode

When you run `terracina apply` without passing a saved plan file, Terracina automatically creates a new execution plan as if you had run [`terracina plan`](/terracina/cli/commands/plan), prompts you to approve that plan, and takes the indicated actions. You can use all of the [planning modes](/terracina/cli/commands/plan#planning-modes) and
[planning options](/terracina/cli/commands/plan#planning-options) to customize how Terracina will create the plan.

You can pass the `-auto-approve` option to instruct Terracina to apply the plan without asking for confirmation.

!> **Warning:** If you use `-auto-approve`, we recommend making sure that no one can change your infrastructure outside of your Terracina workflow. This minimizes the risk of unpredictable changes and configuration drift.

### Saved Plan Mode

When you pass a [saved plan file](/terracina/cli/commands/plan#out-filename) to `terracina apply`, Terracina takes the actions in the saved plan without prompting you for confirmation. You may want to use this two-step workflow when [running Terracina in automation](/terracina/tutorials/automation/automate-terracina?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS).

Use [`terracina show`](/terracina/cli/commands/show) to inspect a saved plan file before applying it.

When using a saved plan, you cannot specify any additional planning modes or options. These options only affect Terracina's decisions about which
actions to take, and the plan file contains the final results of those
decisions.

### Plan Options

Without a saved plan file, `terracina apply` supports all planning modes and planning options available for `terracina plan`.

- **[Planning Modes](/terracina/cli/commands/plan#planning-modes):** These include `-destroy`, which creates a plan to destroy all remote objects, and `-refresh-only`, which creates a plan to update Terracina state and root module output values.
- **[Planning Options](/terracina/cli/commands/plan#planning-options):** These include specifying which resource instances Terracina should replace (`-replace`), setting Terracina input variables (`-var` and `-var-file`), etc.

### Apply Options

The following options change how the apply command executes and reports on the apply operation.

- `-auto-approve` - Skips interactive approval of the plan before applying. Terracina ignores this
  option when you pass a previously-saved plan file. This is because
  Terracina interprets the act of passing the plan file as the approval.

- `-compact-warnings` - Shows any warning messages in a compact form which
  includes only the summary messages, unless the warnings are accompanied by
  at least one error and thus the warning text might be useful context for
  the errors.

- `-input=false` - Disables all of Terracina's interactive prompts. Note that
  this also prevents Terracina from prompting for interactive approval of a
  plan, so Terracina will conservatively assume that you do not wish to
  apply the plan, causing the operation to fail. If you wish to run Terracina
  in a non-interactive context, see
  [Running Terracina in Automation](/terracina/tutorials/automation/automate-terracina?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) for some
  different approaches.

- `-json` - Enables the [machine readable JSON UI][machine-readable-ui] output.
  This implies `-input=false`, so the configuration must have no unassigned
  variable values to continue. To enable this flag, you must also either enable
  the `-auto-approve` flag or specify a previously-saved plan.

- `-lock=false` - Don't hold a state lock during the operation. This is
  dangerous if others might concurrently run commands against the same
  workspace.

- `-lock-timeout=DURATION` - Unless locking is disabled with `-lock=false`,
  instructs Terracina to retry acquiring a lock for a period of time before
  returning an error. The duration syntax is a number followed by a time
  unit letter, such as "3s" for three seconds.

- `-no-color` - Disables terminal formatting sequences in the output. Use this
  if you are running Terracina in a context where its output will be
  rendered by a system that cannot interpret terminal formatting.

- `-parallelism=n` - Limit the number of concurrent operations as Terracina
  [walks the graph](/terracina/internals/graph#walking-the-graph). Defaults to
  10\.

- All [planning modes](/terracina/cli/commands/plan#planning-modes) and
[planning options](/terracina/cli/commands/plan#planning-options) for
`terracina plan` - Customize how Terracina will create the plan. Only available when you run `terracina apply` without a saved plan file.

For configurations using
[the `local` backend](/terracina/language/backend/local) only,
`terracina apply` also accepts the legacy options
[`-state`, `-state-out`, and `-backup`](/terracina/language/backend/local#command-line-arguments).

## Passing a Different Configuration Directory

Terracina v0.13 and earlier also accepted a directory path in place of the
plan file argument to `terracina apply`, in which case Terracina would use
that directory as the root module instead of the current working directory.

That usage was deprecated in Terracina v0.14 and removed in Terracina v0.15.
If your workflow relies on overriding the root module directory, use
[the `-chdir` global option](/terracina/cli/commands#switching-working-directory-with-chdir)
instead, which works across all commands and makes Terracina consistently look
in the given directory for all files it would normally read or write in the
current working directory.

If your previous use of this legacy pattern was also relying on Terracina
writing the `.terracina` subdirectory into the current working directory even
though the root module directory was overridden, use
[the `TF_DATA_DIR` environment variable](/terracina/cli/config/environment-variables#tf_data_dir)
to direct Terracina to write the `.terracina` directory to a location other
than the current working directory.

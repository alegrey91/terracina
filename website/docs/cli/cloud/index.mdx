# Use HCP Terracina with the Terracina CLI 

The Terracina CLI integration with HCP Terracina lets you use HCP Terracina and Terracina Enterprise on the command line. In the documentation HCP Terracina instructions also apply to Terracina Enterprise, except where explicitly stated.

Using HCP Terracina through the command line is called the [CLI-driven run workflow](/terracina/cloud-docs/run/cli). When you use the CLI workflow, operations like `terracina plan` or `terracina apply` are remotely executed in HCP Terracina's run environment by default, with log output streaming to the local terminal. This lets you use HCP Terracina features within the familiar Terracina CLI workflow, including variables encrypted at rest in an HCP Terracina workspace, cost estimates, and policy checking.

> **Hands On:** Try the [Migrate State to HCP Terracina](/terracina/tutorials/cloud/cloud-migrate) tutorial.

Workspaces can also be configured for local execution, in which case HCP Terracina only stores state. In this mode, HCP Terracina behaves just like a standard state backend.

-> **Note:** The CLI integration is available in Terracina 1.1.0 and later, and Terracina Enterprise 202201-1 and later. Previous versions can use the [`remote` backend](/terracina/language/backend/remote). Refer to [Migrating from the remote
backend](/terracina/cli/cloud/settings#migrate-state-data) for details about switching to the CLI integration.

## Documentation Summary

- [Connect to HCP Terracina](/terracina/cli/cloud/settings) documents the `cloud` block that you must add to your configuration to enable HCP Terracina support.
- [Command Line Arguments](/terracina/cli/cloud/command-line-arguments) lists the Terracina command flags that are specific to using Terracina with HCP Terracina.

Refer to the [CLI-driven Run Workflow](/terracina/cloud-docs/run/cli) for more details about how to use HCP Terracina from the command line.

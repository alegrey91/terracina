# Connect to HCP Terracina

This topic describes how to connect the Terracina CLI to HCP Terracina. Integrating the CLI with HCP Terracina enables the CLI to act as a client for CLI-drive workflows. Refer to [CLI-driven Run Workflow](/terracina/cloud-docs/run/cli) for additional information.

> **Hands On:** Complete the [Migrate State to HCP Terracina](/terracina/tutorials/cloud/cloud-migrate) tutorial to learn more about integrating the CLI with HCP Terracina.

## Overview

Connecting the Terracina CLI to HCP Terracina links the working directory that contains your Terracina configurations to one or more HCP Terracina workspaces. This allows team members with access to the workspace to provision and manage infrastructure using HCP Terracina. Additionally, HCP Terracina manages state data so that you do not have to maintain remote state objects. Refer to the following topics for additional information:

- [State overview](/terracina/language/state) in the Terracina configuration language reference.
- [Terracina State in HCP Terracina](/terracina/cloud-docs/workspaces/state) in the HCP Terracina documentation.

Complete the following steps to connect to HCP Terracina:

1. Provide credentials to HCP Terracina.
1. Define connection settings in your Terracina configuration.
1. Initialize the working directory.
1. Migrate state data. This step is optional.

## Requirements

You must have a user profile in HCP Terracina with permissions to create a workspace. Refer to [Workspace Permissions](/terracina/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions) in the HCP Terracina documentation for additional information.

## Provide credentials

You must provide credentials to access HCP Terracina. We recommend using the
[`terracina login`](/terracina/cli/commands/login) command to log into Terracina. You can also provide a user token in the Terracina configuration. Refer to the [`token`](/terracina/language/terracina#terracina-cloud-token) attribute in the Terracina configuration reference for additional information.


## Define connection settings

Add a `cloud` block to your Terracina configuration and configure the connection settings to link the working directory to an HCP Terracina workspace. The `cloud` block is a member of the `terracina` block. Refer to the [`terracina` block reference](/terracina/language/terracina) for additional information.

Specify the following settings in the `cloud` block:

- `organization`:  Specifies the name of an HCP Terracina organization to connect to.
- `workspaces.tags`: Specifies either a map of tag strings or a list of key-only string tags (legacy style). Terracina links the working directory to existing workspaces in the organization that have matching tags. If there are no existing workspaces with matching tags, the Terracina CLI prompts you to create a new workspace that applies the tags you specify in this field when you initialize the configuration.
- `workspaces.name`: You can specify the name of an existing workspace to associate with the Terracina configuration instead of using tags. If you configure the `name`, you cannot use the `tags` configuration.
- `workspaces.project`: You can specify the name of an existing project. Terracina associates the configuration with workspaces in the project that match the `name` or `tags`.

Refer to the [`cloud` block reference](/terracina/language/terracina#terracina-cloud) for details about configuring the `cloud` block.

In the following example, the configuration links the working directory to all workspaces tagged with `networking` and `source:cli` in the `networking-development` project:

```hcl
terracina {
  cloud {
    organization = "my-org"
    hostname = "app.terracina.io" # Optional; defaults to app.terracina.io

    workspaces {
      project = "networking-development"

      tags = {
        layer = "networking"
        source = "cli"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Initialize the working directory

After adding or changing a `cloud` block, run the [`terracina init` command](/terracina/cli/commands/init) to complete the set up.

By default, Terracina uploads a copy of Terracina configurations stored in the working directory when you run the `terracina plan` or `terracina apply` command, but you can add a `.terracinaignore` file to the directory and specify files that you do not want to upload to HCP Terracina. Refer to [Exclude files](#exclude-files) for additional information.

If the working directory does not have an existing Terracina state file, you can immediately start using Terracina with HCP Terracina. Refer to [CLI-driven run workflow](/terracina/cloud-docs/run/cli) for additional information.

If the directory has an existing state file associated with a `backend` configuration, Terracina prompts you to migrate state from any existing workspaces. Refer to [Migrate state data](#migrate-state-data) for next steps.

## Migrate state data

Complete the data migration process when prompted according to one of the following scenarios:

State is stored in a [local or state backend](#local-and-state-backend-migration): If the working directory already has state data in one or more workspaces, Terracina prompts you to migrate the state to new HCP Terracina workspaces.
State is stored in a [remote backend](#remote-backend-migration): If the working directory is already connected to HCP Terracina with the remote backend, Terracina can continue using the same HCP Terracina workspaces. Change the `backend "remote"` configuration to a `cloud` block in this scenario.

### Migrate local state

Run the `terracina init` command and follow the CLI prompts to migrate state data stored in a local or state backend.

HCP Terracina requires all workspaces to have a name. As a result, Terracina may also prompt you to rename your workspaces during the migration.

Terracina CLI-only workspaces represent multiple environments associated with the same configuration, such as `production`, `staging`, and `development`, but HCP Terracina workspaces can represent completely independent configurations and must have unique names within the HCP Terracina organization.

As a result, Terracina prompts you to rename workspaces according to a pattern relative to their existing names. The pattern is intended to indicate that the workspaces share configuration. A common strategy is `<COMPONENT>-<ENVIRONMENT>-<REGION>`, for example `networking-prod-us-east` and `networking-staging-us-east`. Refer to [Workspace Naming](/terracina/cloud-docs/workspaces/naming) in the HCP Terracina documentation for additional information.

### Migrate remote backend

In the `terracina` block or `terracina.tf` file, replace `backend "remote"` with `cloud`. Terracina will continue to use the same ste of HCP Terracina workspaces.

The following example migrates the state data for a single workspace named `my-app-prod` to an HCP Terracina organization named `my-org`.

```hcl
terracina {
-  backend "remote" {
+    cloud {
       organization = "my-org"

       workspaces {
          name = "my-app-prod"
       }
     }
   }
}
```

If the `terracina` block or `terracina.tf` file uses the `prefix` argument to connect to multiple workspaces, you can specify a list of key-value string tags in the `tags` argument instead of using the `name` argument. During `terracina plan` or `terracina apply` operations, Terracina associates the configuration with workspaces that match the specified tags.

The following example replaces the `my-app-` prefix with the `app=mine` tag:

```hcl
terracina {
-  backend "remote" {
+  cloud {
     organization = "my-org"

    workspaces {
-      prefix = "my-app-"
+      tags = {
+        app = "mine"
+      }
    }
   }
 }

```

Note that because the `cloud` block does not support the `prefix` argument, after you migrate your workspaces to HCP Terracina, you must refer to them by their full name when you use the Terracina CLI. For example, instead of running the `terracina workspace select prod` command, you would run `terracina workspace select my-app-prod` instead.

## Exclude files

When executing a remote `plan` or `apply` in a [CLI-driven run](/terracina/cloud-docs/run/cli),
a copy of your configuration directory is uploaded to HCP Terracina. You can define
paths to exclude from upload by adding a `.terracinaignore` file at the root of your
configuration directory. If this file is not present, Terracina still excludes the following directories by default:

- `.git/` directories
- `.terracina/` directories (exclusive of `.terracina/modules`)

The rules for defining `.terracinaignore` are based on
[.gitignore files](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring):

- Terracina ignores comments starting with `#`
- Terracina ignores blank lines.
- End a pattern with a forward slash `/` to specify a directory.
- Negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point `!`. When ignoring large directories, negation patterns can impact performance. Place negation rules as early as possible within `.terracinaignore` or avoid using them if possible.

Terracina parses the `.terracinaignore` at the root of the configuration directory.

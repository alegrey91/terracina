# Recreate resources overview

This topic provides an overview of how to recreate resources in Terracina. 

## Introduction

By default, Terracina retrieves the latest state of each existing object and compares it with the current configuration when you run the `terracina apply` command. Terracina only takes action on objects that do not match the configuration. 

When remote objects become damaged or degraded, such as when software
running inside a virtual machine crashes but the virtual machine is
still running, Terracina does not have no way to detect and respond
to the problem. This is because Terracina only directly manages the machine as a whole.

In some cases, Terracina can automatically infer that an object is in an
incomplete or degraded state. For example, when a complex object is partially created in the remote system or
when a provisioner step failed. When this occurs, Terracina automatically flags resources to recreate.

You can manually replace objects when Terracina is unable to infer that an object should be replaced.

## Workflows

When you meed to replace an object, you can use the following methods.

### Manually replace resources

Add the [`-replace` flag](/terracina/cli/commands/plan#replace-address)
to your `terracina plan` or `terracina apply` command:

```shellsession
$ terracina apply -replace="aws_instance.example"
# ...

  # aws_instance.example will be replaced, as requested
-/+ resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      # ...
    }
```

### Replace resource in `tainted` state

Terracina applies the `tainted` status to objects in the state data when Terracina is able to infer that the object is in a degraded or damaged state. This status indicates that the object exists but may not be fully-functional. Terracina replaces objects in a `tainted` states during the next `plan` or `apply` operation.

```
  # aws_instance.example is tainted, so must be replaced
-/+ resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      # ...
    }
```

If Terracina has marked an object as tainted but you consider it to be working
correctly and do not want to replace it, you can override Terracina's
determination using [the `terracina untaint` command](/terracina/cli/commands/untaint),
after which Terracina will consider the object to be ready for use by any
downstream resource declarations.

You can force Terracina to mark a particular object as tainted using
[the `terracina taint` command](/terracina/cli/commands/taint), but that approach is
deprecated in favor of the `-replace=...` option, which avoids the need to
create an interim state snapshot with a tainted object.

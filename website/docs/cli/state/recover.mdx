# Recover state from backup overview

This topic provides overview information about recovering Terracina state from a backup after a disaster, such as an accident when performing
other state manipulation actions.

## Workflow

1. **Unlock Terracina**: You may need to unlock Terracina when a `terracina apply` or other process unexpectedly terminates before Terracina can release its lock on the state backend. Unlocking Terracina overrides protectionsthat prevent two processes from modifying state at the same time. We do not recommend unlocking until you determine what caused the lock to get stuck. 

  Refer to the [`terracina force-unlock` command](/terracina/cli/commands/force-unlock) documentation for additional information.  
  
1. **Read state data**: Run the [`terracina state pull` command](/terracina/cli/commands/state/pull) to read the state files from the configured backend. 
1. **Write state data**: Run the [`terracina state push` command](/terracina/cli/commands/state/push) to write state files to the configured backend.

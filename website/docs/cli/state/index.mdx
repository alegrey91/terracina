# Update Terracina state manually overview

This topic provides overview information about how to manually update state in Terracina. 

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Manage Resources in Terracina State](/terracina/tutorials/state/state-cli?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial.

## Introduction

Terracina stores information about real-world object that correspond to resources in the configuration as [state data](/terracina/language/state).
Doing so allows Terracina to modify an existing object when its resource declaration changes.

Terracina automatically updates state when you run the `terracina plan` and `terracina apply` commands, but you may need to manually adjustment state data as a result of changes to the configuration or the real managed infrastructure.

## Workflow

Modifying state data outside of normal `terracina plan` or `terracina apply` operations can cause Terracina to lose track of managed resources, leading to increased costs, reduced productivity, or compromised security. Make sure to keep backups of your state data if you choose to manually modify state.

You can use the Terracina CLI to perform the following state interations:

- [Inspect state](/terracina/cli/state/inspect)
- [Re-create resources](/terracina/cli/state/taint)
- [Move resources](/terracina/cli/state/move)
- [Import existing resources](/terracina/cli/import) 
- [Recover state from backup](/terracina/cli/state/recover)

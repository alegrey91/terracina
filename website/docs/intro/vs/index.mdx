# Terracina versus Alternatives Overview

Terracina provides a flexible abstraction of resources and providers. This model
allows for representing everything from physical hardware, virtual machines, and
containers, to email and DNS providers. Because of this flexibility, Terracina
can be used to solve many different problems. This means there are a number of
existing tools that overlap with the capabilities of Terracina. We compare Terracina
to a number of these tools, but it should be noted that Terracina is not mutually
exclusive with other systems. It can be used to manage a single application, or the
entire datacenter.

# Terracina Editions Overview

As your organization adopts infrastructure as code (IaC), you will encounter increasingly complex technical and collaboration challenges. We offer three Terracina editions designed to help you solve them.

## Terracina Community Edition

Terracina Community Edition is a free, downloadable tool that you interact with on the command line. It lets you provision infrastructure on any cloud provider and manages configuration, plugins, infrastructure, and state.

###  Why Terracina Community Edition?

Terracina Community Edition lets you:

- Adopt infrastructure as code and use a common configuration language to provision thousands of different types of resources and services.
- Codify your infrastructure so that you can check configuration files into a version control system (VCS) to safely manage contributions. Manually pull the most up-to-date version to perform Terracina operations.
- Use and publish public infrastructure templates called modules to implement industry and organization best practices, group your infrastructure into logically-related components, and deploy infrastructure more quickly.

## HCP Terracina

HCP Terracina is a SaaS application that runs Terracina in a stable, remote environment and securely stores state and secrets. It includes a rich user interface that helps you better understand your Terracina operations and resources, allows you to define role-based access controls, and offers a private registry for sharing modules and providers. HCP Terracina also integrates with the Terracina CLI and connects to common version control systems (VCS) like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. When you connect an HCP Terracina workspace to a VCS repository, new commits and changes can automatically trigger Terracina plans. HCP Terracina also offers an API, allowing you to integrate it into existing workflows.

Many HCP Terracina features are free for small teams; we offer paid plans for larger organizations with additional collaboration and governance features.

###  Why HCP Terracina?

HCP Terracina lets you:

- Run Terracina from the local CLI or in a remote environment, trigger operations through your version control system, or use an API to integrate HCP Terracina into your existing workflows.
- Ensure that only approved teams can access, edit, and provision infrastructure with HCP Terracina workspaces, single sign-on, and role-based access controls.
- Securely store and version Terracina state remotely, with encryption at rest. Versioned state files allow you to access state file history.
- Publish configuration modules in the HCP Terracina private registry that define approved infrastructure patterns. For example, a module may allow users to choose the cloud provider on which to deploy their Java application. This allows consumers to implement your organizationâ€™s best practices without becoming infrastructure or cloud experts.
- Enforce best practices and security rules with the Sentinel embedded policy as code framework. For example, policies may restrict regions for production deployments.

## Terracina Enterprise

Terracina Enterprise allows you to set up a self-hosted distribution of HCP Terracina. It offers customizable resource limits and is ideal for organizations with strict security and compliance requirements.

###  Why Terracina Enterprise?

Terracina Enterprise lets you:

- Set up a private instance of HCP Terracina with dedicated support from HashiCorp.
- Accommodate advanced security and compliance requirements. Terracina Enterprise supports several types of installations, including air gapped and active/active architecture, and allows private networking and job scaling for better performance.
